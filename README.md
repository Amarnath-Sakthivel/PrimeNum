# PrimeNum

This is a Program which I was faced in mettl test. This platform is more useful for testing by yourself.

Mettl platform: Database Programmer Scoring. ... Mettl's flexible platform lets you thoroughly evaluate database programmers                before making a hiring decision. Our hands-on assessments test candidate application of database queries by requiring them                  to match specific outputs.
               
               Program Description:
                                  case 1: Input contains prime digits
                                  Example:
                                        input  : 1234561179
                                        output : 2357:17
                                  Explanation  : In the input 2,3,5,7 are the prime numbers. So the final output is String of the form of
                                               <concat all the prime digits>:<sum of all prime digits>
                                             
                                  case 2: Input does not contains prime digits           
                                  Example:
                                        input  : 84696
                                        output : 8:6
                                  Explanation : In the input there is no prime digits, So the final output is String of the form of
                                                 <first digit from input>:<last digit from input>
